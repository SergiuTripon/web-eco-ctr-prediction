#### Assignment Brief

The goal of this assignment was to predict the userâ€™s click response to each auctioned ad impression in real-time bidding (RTB) display advertising. Specifically, given the information of the incoming bid request, the bid agent should estimate the probability that the user will click on its ad if it is displayed. For this purpose, we were asked to implement a machine learning regression model to predict the click-through rate based on the training data.
